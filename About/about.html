 When I first moved to London, my favorite activity was visiting all of the markets in the city. There is such a variety of markets and each one has its own personality. Friends started asking me for my favorite recommendations in each market, and then their friends, and so on until I finally decided to start a business giving market tours.

      I started the Markets of London tours in 2018 and it's taken off ever since. I'm a passionate foodie and excited to share what I love with everyone else. Thanks for checking out my website!
